# HRMS Application - Product Requirements Document

## Original Problem Statement
Build and enhance a premium enterprise-grade HRMS web application with role-based access control, onboarding workflow, and notification system.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, openpyxl
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas
- **File Storage**: Cloudinary API
- **Emails**: Resend API

## RBAC System (Implemented Apr 8, 2026)

### Roles & Access Matrix
| Module | HR Team | System Admin | Office Admin | Employee |
|--------|---------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Dashboard | Full | View | View | Employee Portal |
| Employees | Full CRUD | View Only | View Only | Self-Service |
| Attendance | Full + Approve | View | View | Self-Service |
| Leave | Full + Approve | View | View | Apply/Edit |
| Late/Early/Missed | Full + Approve | View | View | Apply/Edit |
| Holidays | Full CRUD | - | View | View |
| Policies | Full CRUD | - | - | View |
| Star Reward | Full | - | - | - |
| Team | Full | - | - | - |
| Payroll | Full | - | - | View |
| Issue Tickets | Full | - | - | Submit |
| Reports | Full + Export | - | - | - |
| Role Management | Full | View | - | - |
| Audit Logs | View | View | - | - |

### Credentials
- HR: `admin` / `pass123`
- System Admin: `sysadmin` / `pass123`
- Office Admin: `offadmin` / `pass123`
- Employee: `user` / `user`

## Notification System (Implemented Apr 8, 2026)
- In-app notification bell with dropdown
- Unread count badge with polling (30s interval)
- Mark as read (single/all)
- Delete notifications
- Triggers:
  - Employee created → HR notified
  - Leave request submitted → HR notified
  - Leave approved/rejected → Employee notified
  - Role changed → User notified
  - Employee created → Office Admin notified for operational setup
  - All checklist items completed → HR notified

## Operational Checklist (Implemented Apr 8, 2026)
Office Admin tracks workplace readiness per employee with 8 checklist items across 5 categories:
- **Infrastructure**: Workstation Ready (desk, chair, system/laptop)
- **Stationery**: Stationery & Supplies Issued, ID Card Issued
- **Access**: Attendance Device Configured, Access Card / Entry Permissions
- **IT**: System Access Created & Verified, Role-based Access Confirmed
- **Coordination**: HR Coordination for Joining Readiness

Status flow: Pending → In Progress → Completed
Auto-created on employee creation + backfilled for existing employees on startup.

## What's Been Implemented

### Phase 1 (Previous Sessions)
- Custom Employee ID & Biometric ID fields
- Bulk Employee Import via Excel/CSV with welcome emails
- Biometric Attendance Ingestion API
- MongoDB Atlas migration + Admin seeding
- Strict dropdowns for Department/Team/Designation
- Leave Application: Start Date / End Date
- Team Member Count display fix
- Attendance Module Pagination

### Phase 2 (Apr 8, 2026)
**Bug Fixes:**
- Holiday duplicate entries fixed (upsert + unique index + dedup on startup)
- Dashboard attendance stats fixed
- Employee attendance date filter fixed

**Leave Module Enhancements:**
- Leave Split: Full Day / First Half / Second Half
- Document upload on leave application form
- Edit pending leave requests
- LOP/No_LOP selection on admin approval
- Admin: Apply leave for employee

**3 New Modules (Late Request, Early Out, Missed Punch):**
- Full CRUD + approve/reject APIs
- Employee + Admin pages with LOP support

### Phase 3 (Apr 8, 2026) - Current Session
**RBAC Overhaul:**
- 4 roles: HR, System Admin, Office Admin, Employee
- Permission-based middleware (ADMIN_ROLES, ALL_ADMIN_ROLES, SYSTEM_ROLES)
- Role migration from old roles on startup
- Role-based sidebar navigation filtering
- Conditional UI elements (edit/approve/delete buttons)

**Notification System:**
- Notification model + CRUD endpoints
- NotificationBell component with unread badge
- Notification triggers for key actions
- Integrated in Layout + EmployeeLayout

**Role Management UI:**
- Permission matrix view
- User roles table with search/filter
- Edit role dialog (HR only)
- Role count overview cards

### Phase 4 (Apr 9, 2026) - 7 Jobs
**JOB 1**: Missed punch forms use datetime-local (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm) instead of time-only
**JOB 2**: Admin missed punch page: date range filters, status dropdown, employee search, server-side pagination
**JOB 3**: Approved missed punch → auto-updates attendance (first_punch/last_punch/status)
**JOB 4**: Duplicate prevention: missed punch, late request, early out, leave (per employee+date)
**JOB 5**: Fixed "Failed to apply leave" bug (NameError: `emp` → `employee`)
**JOB 6**: Leave rules: Sick=past/current only, Casual=4+ working days (excl Sundays), Emergency=any
**JOB 7**: Single leave per day enforcement (blocks duplicate dates, suggests edit instead)
- **P1**: Cloudinary PDF Viewing (blocked on user settings)
- **P2**: Username collision on employee creation - **FIXED Apr 10, 2026**

### Phase 5 (Apr 10, 2026) - Payslip UI & Bug Fixes
- **Salary Slip / Payslip UI**: Professional payslip dialog with company logo (BluBridge Technologies), full compensation breakdown (Base, Allowances, Retirement, Variable, CTC), Insurance Coverage, Employee Deductions, Net Salary, and Print/Download PDF functionality. Component: `SalarySlip.js` (forwardRef for printing)
- **Payslip Redesign**: Redesigned to match reference PDF design - navy blue header banner with BluBridge logo (logo-black.webp inverted to white), employee info card, lettered section badges (A-F), clean single-column monthly tables, red deductions section, gradient net salary card
- **Username Collision Fix**: Auto-appends numeric suffix (e.g., user1, user2) when creating employees with duplicate email prefixes
- **CTC Calculation Fix**: Special Allowance is now the true balancing figure (Fixed + Variable = CTC exactly). Previous bug had total exceeding CTC. Verified against reference salary table.
- **Logo in Print/PDF Fix**: Print handler now converts relative logo path to absolute URL so logo renders in the print window.
- **Research Designation CTC Formula**: New `calculate_salary_structure_research()` function for Research employees — uses B-percentage allocation (LTA=5.6%B, Bonus=9.9%B, Stay=30%B), no Medical/Conveyance, PF fixed at ₹1,800. Non-Research employees unchanged. Designation-based routing via `get_salary_calculator()`.

## Backlog / Future Tasks
- **P1**: Biometric Sync Dashboard
- **P2**: Leave Balance Tracking endpoint
- **P2**: Backend refactoring (decompose server.py ~7000 lines)
- **P2**: Delete deprecated Node.js backend
- **P2**: Onboarding & Induction Workflow (5-step process with induction scheduling)
- **P2**: Reports & Analytics with PDF/Excel export
- **P3**: WebSocket real-time notifications
- **P3**: Rate limiting & API hardening

## Key DB Collections
- `users`, `employees`, `attendance`, `leaves`, `holidays`
- `late_requests`, `early_out_requests`, `missed_punches`
- `notifications` (NEW), `audit_logs`
- `biometric_punch_logs`, `departments`, `teams`

## Key API Endpoints (New)
- `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/notifications` - Notification CRUD
- `GET /api/notifications/unread-count` - Unread count
- `PUT /api/notifications/mark-all-read` - Mark all read
- `GET /api/roles/users` - List users with roles
- `PUT /api/roles/users/{id}/role` - Update user role
- `GET /api/roles/permissions` - Permission matrix
